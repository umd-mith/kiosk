# Kiosk

Kiosk is a [IIIF] viewer for newspapers. It's a work in progress that will
eventually provide a React JavaScript application you can embed on your site to
view newsapers. It's a sister project of [ndnp_iiif] which turns National
Digital Newspaper Program data into IIIF.

## Development

Kiosk was boostrapped with [react-redux-starter-kit]. So you can learn more
about how they put things together and the npm commands that are available over
there.

To get going with Kiosk:

    $ git clone https://github.com/umd-mith/kiosk
    $ cd kisok
    $ npm install
    $ npm start

More details will become available as more development happens :)
